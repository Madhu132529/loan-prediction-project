- Jupyter Notebook

  ## ðŸš€ Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Categorical encoding
   - Feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized patterns using plots and graphs
   - Checked correlation among features
3. **Model Building**
   - Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
   - Used confusion matrix and accuracy score for evaluation
